## Additional features / bugs
Please, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/makyen/StackExchange-userscripts/issues/new) if you desire an additional feature. You should, of course, also do so if you encounter a bug.

## Moderator tools
The "other" category should pick up the moderator tools. I'm not a moderator on any Stack Exchange site, so I'm unable to test it. I'm happy to update the script to have a explicit moderator tools drop-down button location selection. However, to do so I need either access to the top-nav HTML, or, at a minimum, the js-button `class` which is applied to the button (which should look like `js-[something]-button`) and the class applied to the drop-down (which should look something like `[same something]-dialog`). If they have that format, then I need to know the "something". If they don't have that format, I'm going to need the details. I also need to know if it's more than one drop-down button (appears to be so from screenshots). If the moderator tools are more than one drop down, I'm going to need the "something" for both.

## Compatibility notes
*Top Nav Choices* has been tested on Chrome (Tampermonkey) and Firefox (Greasemonkey). It should be compatible with other browsers and user script managers.
