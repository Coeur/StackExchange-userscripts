# User Scripts
This repository contains user scripts for use on Stack Exchange.  The scripts are
compatible with Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey. In general, they will have been tested in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.

##[Roomba Forecaster](https://github.com/makyen/StackExchange-userscripts/tree/master/Roomba-Forecaster) ([install](https://github.com/makyen/StackExchange-userscripts/raw/master/Roomba-Forecaster/RoombaForecaster.user.js))

Is Roomba going to delete the question? If not, why? If so, when?

Adds a "roomba" status line under "viewed"/"active" in the top-right of question pages which shows if the question
will be deleted by [Roomba](http://stackoverflow.com/help/roomba) and how long until the question is deleted.  Why Roomba won't delete the question is, by default, displayed in a tooltip. You can click on the "roomba" status line to open an options dialog to change display settings.
