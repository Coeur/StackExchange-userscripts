##Roomba Forecaster
[install](https://github.com/makyen/StackExchange-userscripts/raw/master/RoombaForecaster/RoombaForecaster.user.js)

Adds a "roomba" line under "viewed"/"active" in the top-right of question pages which shows if the question
is qualified to be deleted by [Roomba](http://stackoverflow.com/help/roomba).  How the information is diplayed is selectable through
options. The default is to display if the question is qualified to be Roomba'ed, and if so how long until it is deleted. Additional information
as to why a question is not qualified for Roomba is, by default, displayed in a tooltip. You can click on the 'roomba' line to open an options dialog.

<sup>Roomba Forecaster is a fork of [RoombaForecast](https://github.com/Siguza/StackScripts/blob/master/RoombaForecast.user.js).</sup>
